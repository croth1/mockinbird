# Configuration file for STAMMP_preProcess.py
# ===========================================
#
# The pre-process is a wrapper for various programs. All Options in [Basic Options]
# must be edited by the user to provide the pre-process script with specific input data,
# directories and mapping indices.
#
# For each program used in the pre-process separate sections exist to change specific program options. The default options
# in this file are currently used in the lab. For detailed parameter description take
# a look at the program's documentations.
